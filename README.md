# rust-quadratic-equation
Solution of quadratic equation in Rust language.

**The principle is on my [website](https://acidec.github.io/2022/11/04/rust-quadratic-equation/). (Simplified Chinese only)**
## Supported operating system
All operating systems with [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) installed.
## Build and run
**Make sure your computer already installed [Rust](https://rust-lang.org).**
### Windows
You can get the source code from github by using [git-for-windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) or download the zip package.

Open command prompt or PowerShell, switch to the path to source code.
```cmd
cargo build
cargo run
```
### GNU/Linux
Run the following command to get Rust:
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```
Get the source code by using Git or download the zip.
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/acidec/rust-quadratic-equation.git
```
It's time to run the program!
```bash
$ cd rust-quadratic-equation
$ cargo build
$ cargo run
```
### macOS
You should get the Command Line Tools(CLT) for Xcode.
```bash
$ xcode-select --install
```
Then run the following command to get Rust:
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```
Get the source code by using Git or download the zip.
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/acidec/rust-quadratic-equation.git
```
It's time to run the program!
```bash
$ cd rust-quadratic-equation
$ cargo build
$ cargo run
```
